# Ameen_LangGraph

A collection of LangGraph and LangChain projects demonstrating various workflows and chat interactions.

## 1. SimpleGraph

A basic LangGraph workflow demonstrating conditional routing between nodes. Features state management, multiple processing nodes, and random conditional routing between paths (happy/sad outcomes).

**Usage**: Open `SimpleGraph.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the graph in action.

## 2. OpenAIChat

A simple LangChain chat implementation using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. Demonstrates creating conversation messages, loading API keys securely from `.env` file, and interacting with OpenAI's chat API.

**Usage**: Open `OpenAIChat.ipynb` to see a basic chat chain implementation with OpenAI.

## 3. Router

A LangGraph router implementation that demonstrates tool calling with conditional routing. The graph intelligently routes between tool execution and direct responses based on whether the LLM decides to use tools or provide a regular response. Features tool binding, MessagesState management, and automatic routing using `tools_condition`.

**Usage**: Open `Router.ipynb` to see tool calling with conditional routing in action.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
